      <div>
        <p>At time of writing, this is the server-side component of a movies web application that provides users with
          access to information about different movies, directors and genres.</p>
        <p>Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information and create a list of their favorite movies.
        </p>

      <h2>API documentation via Postman</h2>

      <div>
        <p>As we are testing all endpoints via Postman I've tried to also have the API documented there. Please take a look at this <a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/26201251/2s93RRvDAq">WIP API on Postman</a>.</p>
        <h3>Why WIP?</h3>
        <p>The API documentation needs some clean-up and generally does not return everything the way I would want it to.</p>
        <p>As recommended by my Mentor, one of my next steps will be to document the API via <a href="https://swagger.io/docs/open-source-tools/swagger-ui/usage/installation/">Swagger</a>, also see <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express">swagger ui express on npm</a>, and here most likely with a `swagger.yaml` file.</p>

        <h3>Why the deletion of the info table that was previously in here?</h3>
        <p>There is no need to manually maintain endpoints/API info within said table, so I deleted it.</p>
