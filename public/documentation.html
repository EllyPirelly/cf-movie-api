      <h2>What is this about?</h2>

      <div>
        <p>At time of writing, this is the server-side component of a movies web application that provides users with
          access to information about different movies, directors and genres.</p>
        <p>Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information and create a list of their favorite movies.
        </p>

      <h2>API documentation via Postman</h2>

      <div>
        <p>As we are testing all endpoints via Postman it makes sense to also have auto-generated API documentation
          there. Please take a look at this <a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/26201251/2s93JwP2hD">WIP API
            on Postman</a>.</p>
        <h3>Why WIP?</h3>
        <p>The API documentation needs some clean-up and more "abstract" endpoints.</p>
        <p>As all of my endpoints do work at the time of writing, it should be fairly easy to update them as we go
          further with the exercise.</p>

        <h3>Why the deletion of the info table that was previously in here?</h3>
        <p>There is no need to manually maintain endpoints/API info within said table, so I deleted it.</p>
